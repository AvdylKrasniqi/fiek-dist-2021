FIEK server is an online server used by fiek students.

## Start the server

- To start the server side, assuming that you have installed the libraries by (npm install), you can simply run node index.js or npm run start

## Start the client side

- Even though the server side returns the production files generated by vue-cli, you can still use npm run serve at client directory.
- If you are testing this on your local enviornment, make sure that your IP is the same as the IP on the App.js and index.html
- For further explanation, read the README file inside client directory.
